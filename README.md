## Task 1: Classical ML with Scikit-learn – Iris Species Classification 🌱

This notebook demonstrates a classical machine learning workflow using the Iris Species dataset. The process begins with data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical labels. A decision tree classifier is then trained to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features. The model’s performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. Each step is clearly commented for clarity and reproducibility.

### Steps covered:

- 📥 Loading and inspecting the dataset
- 🧹 Handling missing values
- 🔢 Encoding species labels numerically
- ✂️ Splitting data into training and testing sets
- 🌳 Training a decision tree classifier
- 🧮 Making predictions and evaluating model performance
- 📊 Visualizing the trained decision tree
